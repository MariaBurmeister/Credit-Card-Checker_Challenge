# Credit-Card-Checker_Challenge

This is a **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) Web Development Path [Project](https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/credit-card-checker)** 

In this **JavaSpript Exercise**, I had to use what I learned from Arrays and Loops.

The program takes series of algarisms and validates them acording to the **[Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)**.

This was fun to solve, but also a bit of a struggle if I'm gonna be honest!
